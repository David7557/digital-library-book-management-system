## 🔥 API Endpoints
| HTTP Method | Endpoint            | Description                        |
|------------|---------------------|------------------------------------|
| `POST`     | `/books`            | Add a new book                    |
| `GET`      | `/books`            | View all books                     |
| `GET`      | `/books/{bookId}`   | Search book by ID                  |
| `GET`      | `/books/title/{title}` | Search book by Title               |
| `PUT`      | `/books/{bookId}`   | Update book details                |
| `DELETE`   | `/books/{bookId}`   | Delete a book                      |

## ⌛ Examples as per API endpoinds format:
   ```sh
   {
      "bookId": "ISBN001",
      "title": "Rich Dad Poor Dad",
      "author": "Robert T. Kiyosaki",
      "genre": "Business"
   }
   ```
## ✅ Constraints
- **Book ID must be unique**.
- **Title and Author must be non-empty strings**.
- **Availability Status must be either "Available" or "Checked Out"**.

## 🏆 Challenges & Improvements
### Challenges Faced
- Implementing a collection-based storage without a database.
- Ensuring uniqueness of Book IDs.
- Handling invalid input cases.

### Future Enhancements
- Implement database integration for persistence.
- Improve exception handling.
- Implement UI for user-friendly interactions.
